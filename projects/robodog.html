IN PROGRESS:

CONTENT:
Inspired by Boston Dynamic's Spot, I decided to experiment more in how machine learning can be applied in robotics and design a robotic dog 
which learned to navigate various environments (such as over pebbles, uneven ground, stairs, etc.) through reinforcement learning.

GENERAL TIMELINE: (want it so that when click on one of the parts on the timeline, it drops to that part)
- Initial Chassis Design and Print
- Hardware Choice
- Power Management (+ initial exhibition!)
- ROS and Joystick Control
- Simulation and RL (I am currently here!)
- Mechanistic Interpretability + Understanding
- Future + Arm (?)
