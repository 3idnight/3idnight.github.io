CONTENT:
I've always had some amount of frustration with studying...

After doing a bit of reading around the subject, I decided to create a web-app which implemented a lot of the learning techniques I found in an
easy format so that I could learn in the most effective way to gain a deep understanding without having to think about what I am doing as the
program would handle all of the thinking behind how to learn. This was largely inspired by the below blogs- I've listed the blogs and which
features I decided to develop inspired by them:

- Neel Nanda: Learning how to Learn (link)

- Iteration: program automatically recommends which technique the user should use to learn the content based on both the content itself and what
techniques the user has found useful in the past. After learning with the technique a few times, the user has the option to reflect on how they 
found the technique so the program can learn what sorts of techniques the user tends to find useful. This links with the next feature...
- Introspection: feelings...
- Spaced Repetition: automatically connecting with the user's calendar and automatically scheduling when the user should study which subject. This 
based on when they last studied the subject and topics within the subject, how their last performance in the subject/topic was and when their next
exams for the subject/topic are. The program automatically scrapes the user's calendar events so the user doesn't have to manually put in their
lectures and the user can designate which hours they are going to work and which hours they will not. 

GENERAL TIMELINE: (want it so that when click on one of the parts on the timeline, it drops to that part)
- Basic Flask Website
